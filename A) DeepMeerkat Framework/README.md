# Analysis
I tested the silver spoon effect in a population of house sparrows on Lundy Island, UK. I ran bayesian linear mixed effect models using the R package "MCMCglmm" (Hadfield, 2010), on Imperial's research computing service.

Raw data files are not included publically and can be provided upon request.

## Langugae
Deep Meerkat was ran with R 3.6.1

## Dependencies
- MCMCglmm 2.32  
- Tidyverse 1.3.0

## Project Structure
