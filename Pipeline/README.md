# Pipeline
This repository contains code to run through whole pipeline, from Deep Meerkat frames to event definitions, to masks extraction by MaskRCNN to sex inference

All models and Meerkat Ouput files can be found in the dropbox link at the end of the written report.

## Langugae
The pipeline was ran with python 3.7.9 and R 4.1.0
