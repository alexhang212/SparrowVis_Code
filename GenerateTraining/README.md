# Generate Training
To generate training data for training deep learning models, I tried matching data from manual annotations with the events obtained from Deep Meerkat. 

## Language
R 4.1.0

## Dependencies
- Tidyverse 1.3.0
- magick 2.6.0

## Project Structure
- **Code**: Contains all code used for analysis  
    - **ProcessFrameInfo.R**: Process Meerkat Outputs and define them into events
    - **GenerateTraining**: Matching algorithm to match events from Deep Meerkat to manual annotation
    - **ProcessImages.R**: Process images into arrays
    - **ProcessVideos.R**: Extract clips from events and build arrays from events for model training
    - **OrganizeEvents_Vids.R**: Runs script above for every video
    - **VideoInfo.csv**: Categorization for test and training split for videos between 2014-2015
